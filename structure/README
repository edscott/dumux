Update: 
parser7.pl is deprecated.
parser8.pl will automatically determine TypeTag for the problem, if it is
hard coded into the call to Dumux::start(). If it is set by means of a preprocessor 
directive in the CMakeLists.txt, then it can be set with the second argument to 
parse8.pl (the first argument being the file from which to start the xml construction).
parser8.pl will automatically determine the path for Dumux templates if the source 
code is located in the conventional "test" way. If not, then the path to the installed
Dumux templated to be used should be specified in the first lines of parser8.pl.

structure.cc has a more descriptive window title and allows drag and drop from the 
treeview to an editor to quickly open the file from which the row was constructed. 
This greatly speeds up browsing the contents of the involved templates. Please note 
that programs linked with gtk+ < 3.16 are not entirely compatible with those linked with 
gtk+ >= 3.16 with regard to DnD. Gvim works fine for me. YMMV.



***********************************************************

To build, just do a "make"
Requirements, gtk3 (developer) and perl.

Once built you will have two programs, the parser (parse7.pl) and the visualizer (structure).

The parser's job is to create an xml file which will detail the way template headers are
included, properties which are defined and typetags and their inheritance relationship.

It is executed with "perl parser7.pl source.cc [problemTypeTag]"

These three items, "Files", "properties" and "Typetags" are the top level elements in a
gtk treeview. 

As the "Files" treeview is expanded, you can see the order and from where each template 
header is included. See Snapshot-1.

When the "Properties" treeview is expanded, you can see all the properties which are 
defined in the included template headers, their value and location. Snapshot-2.

When the "Typetags" treeview is expanded (Snapshot-3), you can see all the defined typetags. If the optional
problemTypeTag is specified, then the xml will use it to create an inheritance chain and you
can see the main type tag with an "emblem-important" icon. First level inheritance have a 
"emblem-default" icon, which by default is a green checkmark. Second level has a solid background
checkmark, third level a simple checkmark and all the rest a blue dot. Whatever does not have
an icon is of no use to the problemTypeTag specified. 

This has helped me speed up looking for what properties are defined and their values, as
well as to get a general idea of the structure of a Dumux aplication.

If I continue with Dumux, I will try to get a Dumux-3.0 parser running, but at the moment the
future is unclear.

And as usual, the code is distributed with GNU version 3 license, hoping that it be of use to others, 
but with no warranty nor suitability of use.
